# XML-Parser

The project is divided into 2 main levels:

-	`Level 1`:
  Handling XML files through a list of operations like : (Prettifying, JSON conversion, minifying, compressing, etc. )

  
•	The first level harnesses a modular approach, enabling users to perform specific operations on XML files based on their requirements. Whether it's detecting errors, orenhancing readability through prettifying, converting to JSON for interoperability, minimizing for efficiency, or applying compression/decompression for storage optimization, the system offers a comprehensive toolkit for XML file manipulation.

-	`Level 2`: Representing XML files data, and social network analysis.

  
•	The second level involves analyzing and visualizing XML data, particularly for social network analysis, providing insights into relationships and patterns between elements within the structured information.
